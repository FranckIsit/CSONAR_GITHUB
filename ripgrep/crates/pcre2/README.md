grep-pcre2
----------
The `grep-pcre2` crate provides an implementation of the `Matcher` trait from
the `grep-matcher` crate. This implementation permits PCRE2 to be used in the
`grep` crate for fast line oriented searching.

### Documentation

[https://docs.rs/grep-pcre2](https://docs.rs/grep-pcre2)

**NOTE:** You probably don't want to use this crate directly. Instead, you
should prefer the facade defined in the
[`grep`](https://docs.rs/grep)
crate.

If you're looking to just use PCRE2 from Rust, then you probably want the
[`pcre2`](https://docs.rs/pcre2)
crate, which provide high level safe bindings to PCRE2.

### Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
grep-pcre2 = "0.1"
```
